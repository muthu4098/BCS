🔹 1. ADB Stack (Android Debug Bridge Stack)

✅ What is ADB?

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line tool used to communicate with Android devices (phone, emulator, etc.) from your computer.

⸻

📚 ADB Stack Layers:
	1.	ADB Client
	•	Runs on your computer.
	•	Sends commands (like install app, logcat, shell, etc.).
	•	Used in Android Studio or command line (adb devices, adb install, etc.).
	2.	ADB Daemon (adbd)
	•	Runs as a background process on the Android device.
	•	Listens for commands from the client and executes them.
	3.	ADB Server
	•	Runs in the background on your computer.
	•	Manages communication between client and device.
	•	Starts automatically when you run an ADB command.

⸻

🔄 Flow:

ADB Client (your PC)  →  ADB Server  ↔  ADB Daemon (on device)


⸻

📌 Use Cases of ADB:
	•	Installing/uninstalling APKs
	•	Logcat debugging
	•	Device shell access
	•	File transfers (push/pull)

🔸 2. Java Stack

✅ What is the Java Stack?

In Java, “Java Stack” can refer to two things:

⸻

A. Java Technology Stack (Software Stack)

It refers to the set of tools, frameworks, and languages used in Java development.

🔧 Example Java Stack:

Layer	Technology
Frontend	JSP, HTML, JS
Backend	Java (Spring, Servlet)
Database	MySQL, Oracle
Server	Apache Tomcat

👉 Used in Java-based web and enterprise applications.

⸻

B. Java Memory Stack (Runtime)

It refers to the memory model used by the JVM when a Java program runs.

💾 Stack Memory:
	•	Stores method calls, local variables, and reference variables.
	•	Each thread in Java has its own stack.
	•	Follows LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) order.

Example:

void methodA() {
   int x = 5;
   methodB();  // new frame added to the stack
}

Each method call gets its own memory block in the Java stack.
