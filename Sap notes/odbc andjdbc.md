ðŸ”¹ What is ODBC?

ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity.
	â€¢	It is a standard API for accessing different types of databases (like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc.).
	â€¢	Developed by Microsoft, it is mostly used in C, C++ or Windows-based applications.

ðŸ‘‰ Main Goal: Allow a program to access any database, no matter what DBMS (Database Management System) is used.

ðŸ”¹ What is JDBC?

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity.
	â€¢	It is a Java-based API to connect and interact with databases from Java applications.
	â€¢	Created by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle).

ðŸ‘‰ Main Goal: Provide a standard way for Java programs to communicate with any database.

ðŸ”„ Key Differences Between ODBC and JDBC

Feature	ODBC	JDBC
Full Form	Open Database Connectivity	Java Database Connectivity
Developed By	Microsoft	Sun Microsystems (Oracle)
Language Support	Language-independent (C/C++ commonly used)	Java only
Platform	Mainly Windows	Platform-independent (Java-based)
Driver Type	ODBC drivers	JDBC drivers
Usage	Used in non-Java applications	Used in Java applications
Performance	Can be faster in C/C++ apps	Optimized for Java environments
Bridge Available	JDBC-ODBC bridge exists (deprecated now)	No need for ODBC

ðŸ§© Types of JDBC Drivers (for extra understanding):
	1.	Type 1 â€“ JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (deprecated)
	2.	Type 2 â€“ Native API Driver
	3.	Type 3 â€“ Network Protocol Driver
	4.	Type 4 â€“ Thin Driver (pure Java, widely used)

ðŸŽ¯ Summary:
	â€¢	Use ODBC if youâ€™re working in non-Java environments.
	â€¢	Use JDBC if youâ€™re working in Java applications.
	â€¢	JDBC is preferred for Java projects because it integrates directly with the Java platform.
