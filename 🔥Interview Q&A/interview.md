### HTML Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What does `<!DOCTYPE html>` mean?**
   It tells the browser to render the page in standards mode as an HTML5 document.

2. **What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.**
   Elements that clearly describe their meaning, e.g., `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`.

3. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?**
   `<div>` is a block-level element, while `<span>` is inline. `<div>` breaks the line, `<span>` doesnâ€™t.

4. **What is the purpose of the `<head>` tag?**
   Contains meta-information about the document like title, styles, scripts, and meta tags.

5. **How do you make a website mobile-friendly using HTML?**
   Use the viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

### CSS Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What is the CSS Box Model?**
   The box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.

2. **Explain the difference between `class` and `id` selectors.**
   `id` is unique for a single element; `class` can be shared by multiple elements.

3. **What are pseudo-classes in CSS? Give examples.**
   They define a special state of an element, e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child()`.

4. **How does `position: relative` differ from `position: absolute`?**
   `relative` positions an element relative to its normal position; `absolute` positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

5. **What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?**
   `em` is relative to the font size of the parent; `rem` is relative to the root (html) font size.

### JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?**
   `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared; `let` and `const` are block-scoped, `const` cannot be reassigned.

2. **Explain event delegation.**
   Itâ€™s a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element to manage events on its children.

3. **What are closures in JavaScript?**
   A closure is a function that remembers the environment in which it was created, even after the outer function has finished.

4. **How does the `this` keyword work?**
   `this` refers to the object that is executing the current function, which varies depending on how the function is called.

5. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**
   `==` compares values with type coercion; `===` compares both value and type without coercion.

6. Explain Flexbox and its main properties.

   * Layout module for flexible boxes; properties include `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`.

7. Difference between `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning?

   * `relative`: relative to itself,
   * `absolute`: relative to nearest positioned ancestor,
   * `fixed`: relative to viewport,
   * `sticky`: toggles between relative and fixed.

* Custom properties declared with `--var-name`, accessed with `var(--var-name)`.

9. How does the cascade and inheritance work in CSS?

   * Cascade: conflicts resolved by specificity and order;
   * Inheritance: some properties pass from parent to child.

10. Explain critical rendering path and how CSS impacts performance.

    * Sequence browser uses to render page; blocking CSS delays render; minimize CSS to speed loading.

# JavaScript Interview Questions (Basic to Advanced)

**Basic**

7. What is hoisting?

   * Variable and function declarations are moved to top of their scope during compilation.

8. How does `this` work in JavaScript?

   * Context depends on how function is called (object method, global, constructor, arrow function).

**Advanced**

* Promises handle async operations; async/await syntax makes promise handling easier.

10. What is the event loop?

    * Mechanism that handles async callbacks by moving tasks from the message queue to the call stack.

11. How does prototypal inheritance work?

    * Objects inherit properties/methods from prototype objects.

12. What are modules in JavaScript?
