## 🧠 **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

> The SDLC defines the steps required to build high-quality software efficiently and systematically.

---

## 🔁 **6 Phases of SDLC**

### 1️⃣ **Planning**

📝 Define the **goals**, **scope**, timeline, and **resources**.
✔️ Involves stakeholder discussions and feasibility analysis.

---

### 2️⃣ **Analysis**

🔍 Gather and analyze **requirements** from users and clients.
🧾 Create a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document.
💬 Focus: *What needs to be built?*

---

### 3️⃣ **Design**

🎨 Translate requirements into **technical design**.
📐 Includes architecture diagrams, UI/UX design, database design, etc.
🧱 Focus: *How will it be built?*

---

### 4️⃣ **Implementation (Development)**

💻 Actual **coding** begins based on design documents.
👨‍💻 Developers write clean, efficient, and testable code.
🛠️ Technologies depend on the project’s tech stack.

---

### 5️⃣ **Testing & Integration**

🧪 Verify the software works as expected.
🔗 **Integration testing** ensures all modules work together.
✔️ Types: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance

---

### 6️⃣ **Maintenance**

🔧 Post-deployment support to fix bugs or add features.
🛡️ Ensure software is **secure**, **updated**, and **optimized**.
📦 Can include regular updates and user feedback.

---

## 📌 **Tools – Ticketing System: JIRA**

🎫 **JIRA** is a widely-used tool for:

* ✅ Tracking bugs, tasks, and enhancements
* 📋 Managing **sprint boards** and **user stories**
* 🔁 Integration with **Git**, **CI/CD**, etc.

## ⚖️ **Waterfall vs Agile**

| Feature     | Waterfall ⛲                | Agile 🔄                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Process     | Sequential 🪜              | Iterative & Incremental ♻️        |
| Flexibility | Rigid                      | Highly adaptable                  |
| Feedback    | Late (after testing)       | Continuous (each sprint)          |
| Testing     | After development          | Alongside development             |
| Delivery    | One-time final product 📦  | Frequent working builds 🚀        |
| Best for    | Fixed scope, low change ❄️ | Evolving projects, quick change ⚡ |

## 🧩 Visual Flow of SDLC + Agile

You could use a **flowchart or timeline GIF** for visual explanation:

* ✅ SDLC → Linearly from Planning to Maintenance
* ✅ Agile → Cyclical (Plan → Develop → Test → Review → Repeat)

🎬 **GIF Suggestion**: Agile sprint cycle animation or SDLC workflow
